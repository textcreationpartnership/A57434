            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Oubtlesse it is not unknown to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours with what various expectations the Nations round about, &amp; even the people amongst us, have fixed their eyes upon you, whom Providence hath set upon the English Throne. Cert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ainely it was farre enough from your owne thoughts within these few moneths, and therefore you cannot be said to have been am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of it, much lesse to have long coveted it. To run di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of mens different opinions touching the Call your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours had thereunto, it cannot be expected, it should not be controverted, since nothing is exempt there from, and not a few believe all knowledge to be <hi>scepticall.</hi> But this I am sure of, that whereas all Powers and Governours hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto did so much seeke themselves, as that either their own or their Predecessors swords made way for them, your Call and admittance hath been so peaceably, as doth clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menstrate the people did not only stand in need of you, but that you are obliged by all ties both divine and humane, to relieve them in this great extreamity of theirs, according to your utmost abilities, and the power which Providence
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62328:3"/> shall invest you with all.</p>
            <p>These Nations have beene reckoning or accounting with their Governours, and such as they sometimes honoured with authority over them for about these do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen yeares; one while advancing and setting up this person and party, and soon after pulling them down again, and at last routing them all, their Corporation and Chart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by which through the prevalency of a crasie depraved major party, they began according to their Predecessors footsteps, to pretend they might by the Prerogative thereof give us stones instead of bread, and Serpents instead of fish, <hi>Mat. 7.</hi> Go on wasting of our blood and treasure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out securing us in the liberty either of our own consciences, persons, or Estates: and whilst we thus bemoaned our sadde condition, sighing, groaning, and crying out, who will doe us good, in rescuing us from selfe-seeking Partisons, your Honours have set your selves in the gap, and undertaken our deliverance.</p>
            <p>Goe on therefore with the same courage and integrity you have begun: and though your Predecessors left you much worke to doe, yet be not disheartned therewith, Supream Authority was never attained too with so much ease before, and cannot portend lesse then greatest Happinesse unto this Nation by improving the same aright, or greatest infelicity unto your selves, if you should forgoe the opportunity which is put into your hands. We say nothing is difficult unto a willing mind, much lesse to such as have both will and power, least of all when both Heaven and Earth concur in making smooth the wayes you have to walke in for working out deliverance unto these Nations. Wherefore as you have begun, goe on in the feare of God, and love to good men, let nothing amuse or startle you; there is no hazard or danger in doing good, and good is not so hardly distinguishable from evill, right from wrong, Mine from Thine, as Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanke
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62328:3"/> Statists, and Lawyers would make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p>Please then to redeem the time your Predecessors have lost, and begin to gratifie us first with what we most stand in need of: Examine our Civill Lawes and Disciplin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, mend, or make them such as may become suitable, wholsome, and thriving to us in time of peace, as our Martiall Laws and Discipline were during the late Warrs. To have no written Lawes may be thought to be a condition without rule, or lawlesse; and yet in whose heart is not the Eternall morall Law engraven'd? might not a people be better gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then this Nation hath been hitherto, without any other rule or standing Law then of not doing that unto any man, which a man would not have done unto himselfe? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the written Law either out-reaches, or doth not reach most cases, it were better to have no writtten Law, no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law at all, then not to have a Chancery to quallifie it, as to contract or stretch it, according to the righteousnesse of all circumstances; but to be subject to the extreamities of them both singly, to be first rack'd, and made weary of our life and cause by the dull senselesnesse of one of them, the Common Law; and after that to be unrackt, rackt backe or over againe by the pleasure, suggestion, or nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the other, the Court of Chancery, will much call the Judgment of this Nation in question, to be out-witted by a generation of Lawyers, and their hangers on, in being at charge to maintaine them at one fifth part of all our Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues yearly, for tormenting us, and continuing our lives and all we have at uncertainty, and their own mercy.</p>
            <p>If we do but consider a little, wee shall easily finde that such a Court as we meane by a Common Law Court, must necessarily be so litterall, so bestial, as that it must not yeeld a haire upon any occasion; as well Gods glory, as good peoples
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62328:4"/> welfare must be sacrificed to it; nothing but <hi>summum jus,</hi> rigid right, or right rigidness, which is <hi>summa inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> extream injuriousnesse, can be expected from it; only a knave or godlesse person who seekes no other happinesse, but his owne Revenge; nor hath other rule or conscience then his owne lust, will easily fence himselfe against the litteralnesse thereof, and expose the Innocent as a prey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
            <p>On the other side, that which we call a Court of Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is such an absolute Prerogative Royall, as that every knave, oppressor, or revengefull person is able, upon no ground or cause at all, but meerely upon suggestion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence and continue a suite, from one generation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with such plausability, according to the printed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Court, and the Courts own contrary practice, as that to heare it argued, a man would not be able to guesse how it will likely be finally determined, about <hi>20.</hi> or <hi>30.</hi> yeares hence, unlesse hee could tell which side were like to have most money to fee most Councellors, and what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors were then so feed: But if you will resolve to dash both Courts in pieces one against the other, and erect one out of them both, endowing it with a power of Equity to Judge all people and causes in a middle way equally and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, as neer the Letter of the standing Law as each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective case can be brought, all circumstances considered according to principles of righteousnesse and reason, and so cashier those Laws, or legall cheates of Fines and Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, Statutes, Statutes-Staple, Recognizances, Leases of Ej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ctment, Mortgages, Penall Bonds, difference of Tenures, difference of Actions, Writs of Error, Outlawries, Bills of Middlesex, and such other Law-legerdemain, the great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Lawyers will be more common, and farre more easie then it is now, to Cook a dinner for their pallate. But</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62328:4"/>
            <p>I beseech your Honours to reflect a little upon what I say in this particular: Our men of Law avouch their Mystery to be the most abstruce and difficult, and consequently to require the greatest art and study to be exact and profound therein of any in the world; whereas above <hi>1600</hi> yeares agoe the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> reproaches the <hi>Corinthians, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>6.5. &amp;c.</hi> in that there was not a wise man amongst them that might judge between his Brethren, and not suffer them to goe to Law before the Heathen: and what kinde of men were these that <hi>Paul</hi> there censures? surely much like the <hi>Coblers, Button-makers, Taylors, Weavers,</hi> with all manner of Handicrafts-men and Labourers, the inferior, poor, illeterate, despised of this Nation, who in the latter times of the world, we have observed to be zealous of the <hi>Honour of God,</hi> inquisitive after. <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> towards their Brethren; and yet <hi>Paul</hi> thought they might, nay ought to have been wise enough to judge between their Brethren: surely <hi>Paul</hi> and our men of Law were of a different opinion, and I must crave leave to add, that if there had been amongst the Gentlemen of the Law-faculty, the like zeale to God-ward, or compassion towards their Brethren, they could never have so long endured to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Ear, and heare so many conscientious innocent people lye under oppression for want of English Lawes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, nor so many righteous Causes to be formally ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, condemned, and made Law-martyrs, without compassing a redresse for us before this time.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>written</hi> Law, <hi>common</hi> Law, <hi>custome,</hi> be in the Cause in question, it will be as clear as the Sun, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no more then first to read the case, then the written Law, and the Judgement will follow as undeniable as the conclusion doth the premises of a rightly formed sillogisme.</p>
            <p>Thus easie and clear would every Cause (to be decided
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62328:5"/> by <hi>common Law</hi>) be, if it were taken in time, before it grew wild by the long run, and leisurely opened, and truly stated.</p>
            <p>But if a Cause do not appeare thus clear to be determined at <hi>common law,</hi> then forthwith the <hi>equitable</hi> part of the Law takes thought of it, and the Judge having both of them to his guide, hath nothing else but this to consider of: That since ther was no <hi>written</hi> Law w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> came home to the point, what a reasonable &amp; understanding man ought to have don in such a case, all circumstances considered: and <hi>2.</hi> how far forth the party complained of, hath acted by the rule ef such reason and understanding (which may be truly said to be the <hi>common law</hi> of <hi>Nature &amp; Nations,</hi> not of <hi>England</hi> onely) and may be presumed to have done, as he would be done unto in such a case, and to give Judgement accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>Now whether upon such like notions, and further enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this, so much pretended dark Mystery of the Lawyers, may not become more prasticable and easie then Cookery, as I said, which is common to every houshold, let those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen themselves, and the most ingenious Professors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest, vvhen they have better leisure, give their opinion, tovvards the undeceiving, and so enfranchising of the People.</p>
            <p>I vvould not be thought notvvithstanding to deny that these Gentlemen have not a kinde of lip-learning, or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, especially of words and tearms, beyond men of other Trades and Callings, wherewith their Customers are either enchaunted, or led into by-paths, beyond their owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and there left and lost both they and their estates. And how far forth such art and cunning is for their owne credit, and our good, let themselves be judges also.</p>

            <p>But of all learning certainly that of the Lawyers is the most vaine, not onely unnecessary but mischievous, destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to a Common-wealth: and I have no little wondred to heare them stiled in every Order, Councellours learned in the Law, but that it is by the Clerks and Registers of the same feather, and for their owne interest sake;<note place="margin">I hope, and earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest such Gentlemen of this faculty, to whom I have any manner of Relation, and such especially to whom I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge many obligations (and who I conceive mean no wors then other men who finde themselves put, or settled by their Ancestors in a way or Calling which they thinke themselves little obliged to question or suspect) that they will not be offended at this language; since all Courtship, fair means, and long-suffering hath prevailed nothing with them, though sundry of the most eminent amongst them, professed the necessity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse, and seriously engaged to see it done severall yeares since.</note> whereas their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is but Law-cheating, jugling, pocket-picking, which the tyranny of our former Governours (fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwise that they should not be thought to have Law as well as Gospel to uphold them in their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, and keeping us in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) suffered us not to speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, or get redressed.

            <p>And because you have herein to deale with a numerous subtile party, the <hi>Anakim</hi>'s and <hi>Goliah's</hi> of the Nation, against whom every individuall true English man, even out of self-preservation is obliged to come in to your assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I, though amongst the least of them, yet being no lesse willing then engaged to appear faithfull in my station, doe humbly tender these ensuing <hi>Proposals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein though I speake often of depositions, examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Certificates taken upon Oath, yet it is onely by reason of the usuall practice thereof at present. My opinion being that Oaths should not be made so common, but that all men should neverthelesse be proceeded against for whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they had damnified any man for false Witnessing, or crrtifying against him, though it were not upon Oath.</p>
            <p>Scarce a motion at Common Law, or in Chancery, but if we offer it not, the Judge cryes out, <hi>Who makes Oath thereof.</hi> At Sessions and at Assizes, all up and downe the land, nothing but Oathing of it, swearing and forswearing, though not so often yet as publicke, and as unpunished, and the parties as remedilesse, though perhaps most Causes are lost by the perjurie of one or other. At Custome-house and Excise Office, nothing to be done without an Oath. Oh the Land doubtlesse suffers, and knows it not, by reason of Oaths, and so much the more have we to answer for, in that we make a meer formlaity thereof. First we make the people swear whether they lwill or no, and when that's done, we rest not thereupon, but cast about how to make them appeare for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworn, and when that's found out, we punish them not at all for the most part, and never proportionable to their transgression: But how easily might thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> land be free from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62328:6"/> these great scandals and offences, and that with much ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ease and advantage, both unto the Governours and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The chiefe use, I meane abuse, of Oaths, is as afore I have said, in our Courts of Justice, and about receipt of the Common-wealths duties of Custome, Excise, and Taxes throughout the Nation. Ʋpon all which occasions it is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That all Evidence given in any Court of Justice, be either by the persons themselves present in Court, and that in such case to be registred, or else by way of Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions taken upon Interrogatories, or Certificate to be signed by the parties Examined, or certifying before a Judg, Justice of Peace, or other Officer appointed in that behalf, who may attest the said subscription, and if any person doe testifie or certifie any thing untrue, to the prejudice of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whether in person, goods, or name, let him be lyable to satisfie all dammages and charges whatsoever, unto the utmost, and be punished corporally, and worke it out, if he have not wherewithall to discharge it otherwise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The securing of the Common-wealths duties without thus Oathing of it, and tormenting of the people is as easily compassed. The late Parliament by severall Acts and Ordinances, ordered them to be paid, and perticularly that of the Excise, according to such rules and rates as are thereby limited, imposing a forfeiture of double the value of the Goods of the Excise whereof the Common-wealth should at any time be defrauded: half this penalty had been sufficient if the said Acts and Ordinances had not imposed upon the people greater trouble and vexation then was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for securing of the duty, or just for the people to be exposed to about payment of it, which the grand Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and their Officers might with so much more ease and comfort to themselves, have executed.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62328:7"/>
            <p>Wherefore for such duties as must necessarily be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, whether of Custome, Excise, or otherwise, when the Rates are once agreed upon, and ordered to be paid and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with as little trouble and vexation as is consistent with security of the duty, the bare forfeiture of the Goods offending will be penalty sufficient, being restitution of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty for one upon most Comodities, one halfe to the Common-wealth, and the other halfe to the Informer: and who but a mad man will adventure ten or twenty to one, if the Orders for preventing frauds be but wisely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, and diligently and faithfully executed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to the Orders, that they be directed especially to secure the duty at the fountaine head, whilest the Comodities are in few hands, and easier to be looked after, as the Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Exporters for the <hi>Customes,</hi> Smelters of Lead, Tinners, Planters, and Grovers of all Native Comodities, Makers and Importers of all manner of Merchandize and Manufactures within the Land, lyable to the duty of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise; and if these be but well taken care of, all the rest of the Nation, perhaps fifty or a hundred for one would be free from any manner of trouble, or vexation, which now every person throughout the Nation, by the letter of the Law, is subject to, if he buy, sell, or receive into his House but <hi>5 s.</hi> worth of any Comodities whatsoever.</p>
            <p>The Excise then may be made payable once a quarter in the-next Market Towne where the parties paying it reside, upon forfeiture of the goods, or full value thereof, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise whereof was not paid accordingly, and for the easier discovery of such fraud it is propounded.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That all persons who are obliged to pay Custome or Fxcise, or that buy of or sell to such person or persons as are obliged to pay the same, may be bound to keepe Books of Accompt as carefull and understanding Merchants and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62328:7"/> ought to doe, wherein they may be required upon a penalty, fairly and truly to enter all and every such parcell or parcells of goods amounting to <hi>20.</hi> s. and upwards, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying the prices at which, and the time when, with the parties names to, or of whom such goods were bought or sold; and being required vpon like penalty to produce their Bookes upon all occasions of cleering or discovering all such persons as shall happen to be questioned about payment of such duties.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That whosoever upon such occasion shall be found to keep false Bookes, be understood and taken as a person that hath deceived the Common-wealth and his Neighbour, and proceeded against as a Perjurer, &amp; made satisfie what the Common-wealth or his Neighbour had, or must suffer in appearance by this deceitfulnesse.</p>
            <p>Now the keeping of Books or Accompts as discreet Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and other Traders doe, though to some it may seem a slight matter, and therefore the lesse necessary to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon all Traders, is yet of so great concernment as that without it such Traders themselves, cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand their owne Estates, nor whether they be in a thriving or declining condition, and consequently not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they get or loose by that Commodity, or whether at the yeares end they ought to enlarge or contract themselves; but goe on blind-fold untill they runne quite out of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, to the undoing of themselves, and all that are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with them. But if it be granted to be a trouble to keepe Bookes of Accomps of what they buy or sell, and therefore ought not to be imposed upon a free people. It is answered, that it saves and prevents them &amp; hundreds of others the trouble and vexation of being questioned in other occasions, which is not only a more common good, but to them a more peculiar advantage if they knew how to make a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62328:8"/> thereof: Besides, this exact keeping of Accompts is a kind of Record of all their dealings, which, whosoever are partners with them may have recourse to, and see what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or losse accrues by such trading, and at least be sure that they fare as well as he that hath the managing of the Trade, and according to the Covenants between them, and from hence it happens, that for the most part all Noble men, Gentlemen, and others, as they are distinguished in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Low Countries (two industrious and ingenious Nations, and such as we need not be ashamed of, to take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample by in businesse of this nature) that are populous. When they have money by, do willingly adventure it with Merchants and Shop-keepers, and goe partners or sharers in their dealings for all parts of the world, to the much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of those Countries; whereas here in <hi>England,</hi> if a man put in a summe of money in stocke with a Merchant, Shop-keeper, or Grasier, or other dealer, it is twenty to one but such Adventurer shall not only loose his money, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have good account how it came to be consumed and wasted, because such persons who had the managing of the businesse kept no exact account of their dealings, for such Adventurer to have recourse unto, and see how his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thrived from time to time, and so contribute his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice therein as occasion and the nature thereof might have required.</p>
            <p>I purposely forbeare to alledge any reasons for this or that Proposall, or to presse the necessity of any of them so farre as I justly might, because I know you have so little leisure to peruse them, and believe that the Lawes with the present Proceedings are become so vexatious unto this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion generally, as that you cannot choose but behold the people to be weary of them, and resolved not to endure them longer, but rather choose to make tryall of any other
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62328:8"/> then that the same should be still continued: But withall do not doubt but that the rationality, and demonstrablenesse of most of these Proposalls will appeare so cleare unto your Honours, as will not only stirre up a resolution in you, but will keep you mindfull, untill you have new modelled, if not quite new made them, as you shall see cause for.</p>
            <p>The next generall which requires your Honours speedy assistance, may be the securing or enriching of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or both in one, and that consists in trading; for a people that shall be content to apply themselves to Tillage and Pasturage only, which possibly may be sufficient to finde themselves with food and rayment, will not be long able to protect themselves from Invasion of Forraigners, in regard such Land or Countrey would be exceeding thin of people, and not able to defend it selfe in all their quarters against such as would invade them.</p>
            <p>There cannot therefore be any lasting security without trading. Trade like a continuall Market or Faire, invites people from all bordering Countreyes, and makes a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion become populous: Besides, the greatest Trade of the world hath a capacity of undermining and eating out the lesser Trades of the world: the greatest Trade cannot be compassed without the greatest strength at Sea; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever can make and continue the greatest strength at Sea, will enjoy the greatest Dominion of the world, which would long since have been reduced to one Monarchy, or one Common-wealth, had not such Monarch or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, who at any time was most powerfull, and so in the fairest capacity of reducing all the rest, fallen short in their politicks and Goverment.</p>
            <p>Had the Ʋnited Provinces been reduced into one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, they had beene in a likelier posture of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing this universall Monarchy, then ever the <hi>Romans</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62328:9"/> were, who purchased all they had at the swords point; or the modern Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> who thought to have done it by their West-India Treasures, as indeed they might, had they withall but known, and joyned thereto, the maine Engine, and right State-mystery of compassing the same, which is to encrease Trade and Navigation. But this proud Nation stands so much upon what they call Gentility, and is no other then a condition not to be necessitated to worke, as that they will not labour in any callng an houre longer then to keepe themselves from starving. A very Farrier will stand at his doore with a grave bayes Cloake on downe to his heeles, and his Rapier by his side, untill you bring your Horse to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to be shoed, and then to worke he goes; so soone as your Horse is shoed, on goes his long Cloake and Rapier again, and hee as great a Don as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; which being the humour of the whole Nation, they are so farre-besotted therewith, as that much like the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Guinney,</hi> they exchange their gold and silver of the West Indies, wherewith they might either have traded all the world out of their possessions by degrees insensibly for nothing, or bought them out of their free-hold at above forty yeares purchase; I say so many millions of money have they parted with unto other Nations for trifles to feed their own pride and luxury, which hath not onely set those other Nations at Warres amongst themselves, but enabled them to oppose the Spaniard in his aspiring unto the Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Monarchy.</p>
            <p>But let us take heed, the united Provinces have first made discovery of this grand Engine and State-mistery of encreasing Trade and Navigation for acquiring Dominion, and conserving it by good Government, wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell all Governours of the world, by distributing Justice at home both indifferently and speedily, and protecting such
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62328:9"/> as live under them from all Forreign Enemies abroad; th y have made use thereof, and thrived thereby beyond all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer generations; and had they but gained <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Bridges,</hi> and been reduced into one Common-wealth or Principality (which might as easily have been done, and is still to be done as easily, as it was for <hi>England</hi> (which our eyes have seene) and <hi>Scotland</hi> to become one in <hi>12.</hi> moneths) before we attaine to be true Trade-Statesm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n) neither these three Nations most appropriate to command the rest, if we knew our own strength, nor any other in likelihood would be timely wise enough to oppose the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enlarging of their Dominions.</p>
            <p>Now these two generals I presume your Honours will find necessary to be speedily dispatched, and that sundry others may not be left undispatched, as the freeing tender consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from paying Leviticall Tithes unto a Gospel-ministry which they owne not, the keeping people from begging and starving in the streets for want of employment. The lessning or quite taking away Taxes so soon as may be, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of no lesse Import, which I was bold to propound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the late Parliament; and had they put in Execution, as they might have done with no lesse ease unto themselves, then great advantage unto these Nations, their Honours would not have been so blasted as we now behold them. But since they still remain undone, and continue still to be of the same necessary concernment both unto our security and well being, I crave leave to annex them hereunto, not without some assurance, that if your Honours shall be at liesure to cast an eye thereon (and find that a stocke of money enough to compasse all of them, defray all manner of publick charge, and enable the Parliament by degrees, even in a few yeares to take off all manner of Taxes and Excise; and whatsoever else may be desired is as easily attainable without giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It will then doubtlesse be easily perceived that the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, the men of Law, the whole Tribe, from the Judges to the Prison-door-keepers, though some of them, as to their

            <p>It was this Tribe that was so ready and willing to do their drudgery, that they might be maintained in buying and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Nations over and over, as often as they pleased; at one Terme or Tryall the Plaintiffe, and at another the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, then back againe, and then forward, and all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to as good Law or Equity, as hath been in <hi>England</hi> since <hi>William the Conquerour.</hi> And besides all this, though they seem to have but one chief Shop at <hi>Westminster,</hi> a few stals erected for them in the Circuits, and their owne private Ware-houses at home, yet this one Tribe is thought to make a shift to gaine or reap one fifth part of all the gaines and increase of the whole Nation, by their severall wayes of incomes, which I know not well how to term, whether Fees, Bribes, Duties, or Extortions, they seem so like one another, or the same sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up together.</p>
            <p>The knowledge of the Lawes whereby a man injoyes his life, liberty, and estate, and through breach whereof he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits all this temporall life affords, is not of lesse absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, as to the things of this world, then the knowledge of those religious, eternall, fundamental principles of Faith and Love, without which it is impossible to attaine the joyes of Heaven. And therefore our Lawyers in their spheare are no lesse Monopolizers &amp; Usurpers, then the Prelaticall or Popish Clergie, who endeavour by all means to continue us in the ignorance of our earthly patrimony and birth-right, the Lawes, not contenting themselves onely to perswade, but even in a manner compelling us to rest satisfied with an implicite knowledge thereof, and so in effect to depend totally upon themselves, and hold at their mercy our very lives, liberties, and estates.</p>

               </gap>ers and Lordly Bishops, could not have been brought unto Account, when they perceived and saw they had outgon their own politiques in questioning of them so far as that they could not retreat for shame, nor yet with safety, they then resolved to put the best face on it, and joyne not onely in executing Justice upon them all, but began to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their owne irregularities, and exorbitances, even not to be longer endured, and promised Reformation, which they have been (even round) about these ten years, and at last suffered Commissioners to be chosen to consider of the Regulation of the Lawes, and Courts of Justice, who that they might not be over-charged with so great a task, they gave them halfe a dozen of Gentlemen of the same tribe, to save them a labour (I wish it proved so) and what fruit it produced, is best knowne unto themselves; but it seems the late Parliament could not digest, but still grew worse and worse untill its dissolution: And these poor Nations still continued to be mis-governed by a hotch-potch of Linsey-wolsey Lawes, so numerous, as not to be learned or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, so me so differing as that they contradict and give the lye to one another, so irrationall and absurd, to spare worse words, as that they character us to be one of the most barbarous people in the world. And that which is yet worse then all the rest, the evill execution of them with their dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torinesse and charge in so high a measure as demonstrates us over-dull and stupid to endure them hitherto.</p>
            <p>In the making of all our Statute Laws, the establishing the Kings Prerogative was more aimed at then estating the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in freedome, which though never so much the peoples due and birth-right, if ever they vouchsafed us any Crums thereof, they forbore not to entitle them pure acts of highest grace and favour. Now for a people redeemed out of the jaws of Tyranny, and desirous to settle and establish themselves, and be made happy under a Common-wealth Government, with the self-same Lawes which were either wrung from their exclud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d Tyrants in their exigency, or any wayes indulged (as they would have it accounted) is no more possible then for a Tyrant to erect and long to continue an Usurped Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, while he governed by a body of Lawes that had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62328:12"/> been enacted by the free people of a Common-wealth. Let us therfore no longer idolize that thread-bare notion of fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Lawes, wherein perhaps the whole Nation hath too much, too long hypocritised. And yet I hope no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then an honest Traveller, who in discretion is bound to give out no offensive words, whilest he finds himselfe encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed by Theeves: Wherefore let not any of our former Lawes or Customes, no more then our Religion hath done, passe unexamined, and so scape being blasted or allowed of as they shall tend to the true freedome, securing, enriching, and contenting of the people of the Nation.</p>
            <p>To be led implicitely to accept of Lawes we either have not tryed, or understand not, is the second grand indiscreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which a Nation can possibly commit, and inferior onely to that of being superstitiously hurried by an implicite Faith in matter of Religion, as aforesaid. But will we in one word or circumstance see the unlikelyhood of the Lawes becoming wholesome to us, without more then a little rectifying, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying, if not quite new-moulding them?

               </p>
               <p>The having so many severall sorts of Courts, especially one differing from, and condemning what the other Judged to be just and righteous, doubtlesse was not onely one of our Tyrants stratagems to keep the people in vassalage; but the Lawyers great Engine to make more work for themselves. They first tell you, and that plausibly enough, that the world is stark naught, and that therefore a man cannot be too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and cautelous in contracting with any person, or what security he takes; and thereupon councel him to get a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and sale, a mortgage, or a penall Bond, or sometimes all of them together, double, treble, and perhaps six times as much as the Debt imports: Now if this party be put to sue upon either of them, or all, though he would be contented to take his bare debt with interest and charges, he is not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to sue for the same in Chancery, but is turned over to the Common Law, where he may not demand lesse then the whole Forfeiture, be it never so much, and the Common Law will give it as certainly, whether it be right or wrong, if he can but declare and lye after the Common Law fashion; but he had need be well versed and precise therein, for if he come short of a letter, nay if a letter do but look asquint, an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or a knavish Jury may put him to begin againe, or loose all, both principall and penalty. In commiseration whereof, our good Governours, and yet the selfesame Tyrants, and their equitable Lawers, prevail'd to possesse this over credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Nation how reasonable it was to have a Coure of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery to qualify and mitigate the rigor and Tyranny of the Common Law.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62328:13"/>
               <p>The truth is, the Common Law is extravagant enough, to say no worse of it, but to flye therefore into the Chancery is a remedy worse then the disease, leaping out of the Frying-pan into the fire is not so bad. The Common Law, if our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torneyes were true to us, would not keep us long in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, but of the torments of Chancery you must have good luck if you find either end or respite, to doe you good; and your adversary must want money to see Lawyers, enough to confound the Cause, and muddy the waters, as they doe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually, that a Register (who doubtlesse made more Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders then the Judges) seldome gets fast hold thereof, though he make a hundred Orders at his pleasure.</p>
               <p>How easie a matter were it then to prevent such waste of time and moneyes in following two Courts so diametrically opposite? Had you not better that either of them should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch you, and put you out of paine speedily, then to be ground in pieces between them both so long together?

               <p>But let us see what kind of reliefe it is a poor man gets by flying into the Chancery?</p>
               <p>Suppose a Verdict is by perjury, surprisall, or otherwise, unduly obtained against a man, whereupon he gets an injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and serves his adversary himselfe, the then Attorney, and Councellor; the party afterwards Fees other Councel, perhaps another Attorney, obscures himselfe, and carries on the Cause to an execution, and puts the party in prison, and then no remedy because the Judges forsooth they may not be served with the Injunction.</p>
               <p>Surely a Nation is at an evill passe when it must be perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and squeesed to pieces between their Courts of Law, and equity, whilest the Officers thereof between complementing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62328:14"/> and envying each others, erect their owne jurisdiction and prerogative. Certainly the Court of Chancery as Supream ought to have its Injunctions obeyed even by all other Courts and the Officers thereof, otherwise what availes it to direct an Injunction to Councellours, Attorneyes, Sollicitors, Agents, when as if you have served all but one in <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall, that one onely may doe the feate, and consequently quite fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the injuntion; wherefore although the Chancery doe not direct them to the Court and Judges themselves, with all their Officers in generall, doubtlesse it could not be out of at ny other consideration, then of respect unto the said Court and Judges, who by the same rule ought, when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand of an injuntion in a Cause, not to proceed any further, out of the same respect to the Chancery their Superiour.</p>

Secondly, when the poor Debitor feeling the Rope about his neck, expresses an unwillingnesse to be made thus accessory to lying and his own ruine, it is told him, the Chancery will forgive and pardon him; whereupon to prevent strangling at that instant, he sets his hand and seale, and gets a Reprieve for six moneths longer, or some such breathing time, which being expired, the Creditor is not admitted to goe the nearest way about by the Chancery, to regaine his principall with interest and charges, which some of them would be contented with, but must first goe to Common Law, and get the forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of the Bond, and an entry upon the Mortgage, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards use the best means he can, that the Chancery after some yeares progresse, may make an end of undoing what the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law had done, before he can be at liberty to receive and injoy any part of satisfaction.</p>
               <p>In briefe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Cashiere all supernumirary Officers, as the Masters of Chancery, Six Clerks, Prothonotaries, with all such as serve themselves more then the Common-wealth, and let necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62328:21"/>2. Let all parties be heard and dispatched as they come in course.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the Judges be fineable for every erroneous or unjust judgement.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let the party demanding, put in his demand in writing, signed by himselfe, and leave a Copy with his adversary, who may be obliged to answer as speedily as the place where he lives, and other circumstances permit, and each be finable to the other, full costs and dammages, if they ask what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, or deny what is reasonable.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Settle the County Register of Lands, with their incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, so often promised, and so much seemingly intended by the last Parliament.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Encourage in such (or any better) manner as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, a voluntary Register of Bills and Bonds, whereby they will become currantly assignable; which two Registers onely would have much relieved us from the Lawyers op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Let there be no distinction of Courts of Chancery and Common Law.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Let there be County Courts, and let the Judges or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners thereof have power to judge all Causes indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, having regard both to the letter of the Law, and the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, as in a middle way between them both.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Let but one, or at most but two Councellours be heard on any side, either at Motion or Tryall; and that the parties or any friends of theirs, be free to speak in the Cause.</p>

Let the Judges peruse the whole proceedings, and signe the Judgements, and Decrees themselves, and be obliged to condemne the guilty in interest, charges, and all manner of dammages; so may we for the future be happy in the Lawes protecting us, as we have hitherto been miserable, through their entanglements and thraldome.</p>
               <p>But since neither a new body of Lawes can be prepared on a sudden, nor the old Lawes or proceedings be so soon new modelized as were to be wished; as also in that there are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Causes, both at Common Law, and in Chancery, which cannot be dispatched for want of time, and if turned
